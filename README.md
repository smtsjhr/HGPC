HyperGraph Product Codes Visualizer

View at [smtsjhr.com/HGPC](https://smtsjhr.com/HGPC/).

This demo illustrates some of the results presented in ["Partitioning qubits in hypergraph product codes to implement logical gates"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10812v1).

Check out the script [HGPCode.js](https://github.com/smtsjhr/HGPC/blob/main/HGPCode.js) for a general class implementing the relevant functionallity 

** NOTE:: This is a Work In Progress **
